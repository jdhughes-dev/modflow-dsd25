    "## Description of the flow problem\n",
    "Consider two-dimensional flow with a warm well and a cold well. The warm well inject water while the cold well extract water and vice versa. The model area is a rectangle of 505 m by 305 m. Cells are 5 by 5 m (relatively large so that the model runs quickly), so the model consists of 61 rows and 101 columns. The initial temperature of the aquifer is 12$^\\circ$C. Injection temperature of the warm well is 17$^\\circ$C and of the cold well 7$^\\circ$C. The warm well is located at $(x,y)=(-100,0)$ and the cold well at $(x,y)=(100,0)$ (the origin is at the center of the model). The head is fixed to $h_R$ along the entire model boundary. Flow is considered to be at steady state instantaneously. The model consists of 1 layer to make sure the model runs fast enough for this workshop. "

When creating the grid, the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the lower-left-hand corner of the grid are specified. The row and column number of the cells that contain the wells can then be determined with `flopy` commands.  Both a warm and a cold well are specified with equal but opposite discharge. Constant-head cells are specified along the entire model boundary. Other than that, the function is very similar to the function we used in the first notebook."

    "The model we created in this notebook is purposely more approximate than you may want in practice, so that the notebook runs fairly fast in the workshop. In practice, you have to use smaller cells, especially near the wells, and add semi-confining layers above and below the aquifer and divide the aquifer and semi-confining layers up in multiple model layers, as we did in the second notebook. This will significantly reduce the recovery efficiency (and increase the runtime). "
